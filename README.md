# DartsSim

Me and my Uni-friends recently started playing darts. As we are quite bad (i.e. our throws have a large standard deviation) we asked ourselfes if it ist better to aim at the bullseye or at triple twenty. Then generalised the question even more: Depending on your skill level, what target should you choose to maximize your expected points on three darts.

The code provided here can be used to answer this question. It enables the user to efficiently simulate a large number of throws with a given target and standard deviation.
